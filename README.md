# StellaronStudios
Github repository for Stellaron Studios' VR contemplation project.

# Installation instructions

# Unity Editor
NOTE: To run VR Contemplation via the editor, Unity Editor 2023.2.20.f1 needs to be installed. This does not have to be installed before cloning the repository, however, it will prompt when attempting to launch the project via the Unity Hub.

The most optimal method to install VR Contemplation is to clone the repository using GitHub Desktop. The cloning process will take time and could potentially fail due to the large number of assets involve. If the cloning fails initially, simply restart the cloning process until it’s successful. 

Upon cloning the repository, simply open the Unity Hub and select “Add”. When in the file explorer, select the Stellaron Studios folder to access the VR Contemplation project.

# Build Version
When cloning the repository to the desired machine, simply access the file via the file directory and select the “App Build” folder. Within that file, an application file should be present which the user can select to access the application.
Application instructions
Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a simple menu by which they have the option to begin the experience or exit the application.
 
When beginning the experience, users are presented with an environment which is based on New Zealand. A soundscape will be playing, and the sun will be positioned towards the middle to set the environment to midday.

As this application was designed to allow players to relax and isolate themselves, there are no particular instructions for how the player should respond to the environment, they are expected to relax their minds and focus on the environment presented in front of them. Fauna and rocks have been set within the environment to serve as boundaries for the player. 

It is recommended that the player does not spend too much time within the environment to prevent motion sickness or any other sort of illness which could occur/aggravate.
